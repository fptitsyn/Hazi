# Hazi
Hazi is a mobile app aimed to help people be more productive, find motivation and reduce stress and emotional burnout. The app is currently unfinished.
It provides convenient tools to plan your tasks and gives you motivation using a tamagochi-like system. You have a pet that you can look after by completing your tasks.
Hazi has a working Firebase database and a system for users' authentication. It can also send you notifications about your pet state.
It uses a modern system of in-app navigation via Jetpack Navigation.
